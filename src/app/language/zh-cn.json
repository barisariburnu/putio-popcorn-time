    "The TV Series tab, that you can reach by clicking 'TV Series' in the navigation bar, will show you all available series in our collection. You can also apply your own filters, same as the Movies, to help you decide what to watch. In this collection, also just click the cover: the new window that will appear will allow you to navigate through Seasons and Episodes. Once your mind is set, just click the 'Watch Now' button.": "点击导航栏中的“电视剧”标签页，会显示库中所有可用的电视剧。和电影一样，您也可以按自己的喜好来过滤想看的节目。在库中点击电视剧封面，新的窗口将会提供季和集的导航。挑选完毕后，点击“立即观看”即可。",

A green torrent will be downloaded quickly, while a red torrent may not be downloaded at all, or very slowly. The color grey represents an error in the health calculation for Movies, and needs to be clicked in TV Series in order to display the health.": "在电影/电视剧详情页，您会看到一个小圆点，呈现灰、红、黄、绿不同颜色。这些颜色反映了种子的健康度。绿色的种子下载速度非常快，红色的种子则可能根本无法下载。灰色代表电影的健康度计算有误，在电视剧列表中需要手动点击灰色圆点来查询其健康度。",

    "Torrent streaming? Well, torrents use Bittorrent protocol, which basically means that you download small parts of the content from another user's computer, while sending the parts you already downloaded to another user. Then, you watch those parts, while the next ones are being downloaded in the background. This exchange allows the content to stay healthy.": "种子的边下边播如何实现？简单来说，您的种子文件使用Bittorrent协议，从其他用户的电脑上下载微小的文件区块，与此同时您已下载好的区块将发送给其他用户。您观看已下载区块的同时，后台正在下载紧接其后的内容。接收进来的同时分享出去，能使种子的健康度得到保障。",
    "Once the movie is fully downloaded, you continue to send parts to the other users. And everything is deleted from your computer when you close Popcorn Time. As simple as that.": "电影下载完毕后，文件区块将继续上传给其他用户。当您关闭 Popcorn Time 时，所有数据都将从您的电脑中删除。就是这么简单。",
