# Contributing to Popcorn Time

So you're interested in giving us a hand? That's awesome! We've put together some brief guidelines that should help
you get started quickly and easily.

There are lots and lots of ways to get involved, this document covers:

* [raising issues](#report-a-bug)
    * [bug reports](#bug-reports)
    * [feature requests](#feature-requests)
    * [change requests](#change-requests)
* [working on Popcorn Time core](#core)
    * [submitting pull requests](#submitting-pull-requests)
* [translation](#translation)


## Report a bug

If you're about to raise an issue because think you've found a problem with Popcorn Time, or you'd like to make a request
for a new feature in the codebase, or any other reasonâ€¦ please read this first.

The GitLab issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports),
[feature requests](#feature-requests), [change requests](#change-requests) and [submitting pull
requests](#submitting-pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **search for existing issues**. Help us keep duplicate issues to a minimum by checking to see if someone
has already reported your problem or requested your idea.

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use
  [the forum](http://discuss.popcorntime.io) or IRC - #popcorntime on freenode).

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

### Bug Reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitLab issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `master` or look for [closed issues](/popcorntime/desktop/issues?state=closed).

3. **Include a screencast if relevant** - Is your issue about a design or front end feature or bug? The most helpful thing in the world is if we can *see* what you're talking about.
Use [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to quickly and easily record a short screencast (24fps) and save it as an animated gif! Embed it directly into your Jira issue. Kapow.

3. Use the Bug Report template below to start creating a bug report with the template automatically or [click here](http://bit.ly/1F6aC3w).

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Be sure to include the details of your environment.

Template Example :
```
Short and descriptive example bug report summary (title)

### Environment

The OS environment in which the issue occurs. 

### Steps to Reproduce
If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.

1. This is the first step
2. This is the second step
3. Further steps, etc.

Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. Especially, why do you consider this to be a bug? What do you expect to happen instead?

### Technical details:

* Popcorn Time Version: stable 0.3.7
* Downloaded from: popcorntime.io
* Connection: 10mbs
* OS: MAC OSX
```

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. Before you submit one be sure to have:

1. Read the [Roadmap](/popcorntime/desktop/wikis/roadmap) and
[Planned Features](/popcorntime/desktop/wikis/planned) listing, **use the Jira search** and check the feature hasn't already been requested.
2. Take a moment to think about whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project, or if it might
better fit being an app/plugin.
3. Remember, it's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's leaders of the merits of this
feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible, this means explaining the use case and why it is
likely to be common.
4. Clearly indicate whether this is a feature request for Core, or for packages.


### Change Requests

Change requests cover both architectural and functional changes to how Popcorn Time works. If you have an idea for a
new or different dependency, a refactor, or an improvement to a feature, etc  - please be sure to:

1. **Use the GitLab search** and check someone else didn't get there first
2. Take a moment to think about the best way to make a case for, and explain what you're thinking. Are you sure
this shouldn't really be a [bug report](#bug-reports) or a [feature request](#feature-requests)? Is it really one
idea or is it many? What's the context? What problem are you solving? Why is what you are suggesting better than
what's already there? Does it fit with the Roadmap?


### Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are awesome. If you're looking to raise a PR for something which doesn't have an open issue, please think carefully about [raising an issue](#report-a-bug) which your PR can close, especially if you're fixing a bug. This makes it more likely that there will be enough information available for your PR to be properly tested and merged. To make sure your PR is accepted as quickly as possible, you should be sure to have read
all the guidelines on:

* [code standards](/popcorntime/desktop/wikis/code-standards)
* [commit messages](/popcorntime/desktop/wikis/git-workflow#commit-messages)
* [cleaning-up history](/popcorntime/desktop/wikis/git-workflow#clean-up-history)
* [not breaking the build](/popcorntime/desktop/wikis/git-workflow#check-it-passes-the-tests)
